## Hack-Challenges

### Tracks

Here are the two different tracks we have open and some example ideas you can
inspire yourself from/copy

#### xChain dapps  - Total Prize pool of USD 5k


The Internet Computer is a unique platform to build cross-chain dapps. In the
workshops, you’ll get introduced to threshold ECDSA, the Bitcoin integration,
ckBTC, HTTPS outcalls, and the [IC-ETH-Starter] template as an example.

In this track, you are challenged to use one or more of these powerful building
blocks to create a novel application. In the following, we have listed some
projects you could tackle.

##### Prizes

1. USD 3k in ICP grants
2. USD 2k in ICP grants

[You can pick ideas from](https://github.com/dfinity/grant-rfps/blob/main/requests-for-startups.md)

**How to Get Started:**
1.  Attend the coding and tutorial sessions in the hacker house if you prefer to develop in Type Script; 
2.  Or if you are already a Rust or Motoko developer, watch this [Youtube tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEuI43g1m94) to get an overview of the [IC-ETH-Starter] project.

#### Fully on-chain dapps - Total Prize pool of USD 5k

Utilize the Internet Computer to build a fully on-chain dapp. Consider using a
starter project or a sample dapp to kickstart your development. Here are some
possible directions you could take


-   **SocialFi applications** - Social interactions on chains means that users own their data. On ICP you can host websites and interact with smart canisters directly from the browser. On top of this, ICP has the smoothest user onboarding experience. No wallet necessary.
-   **DAO tooling** - ICP has the capability of hosting the entire governance process for DAOs on-chain. Show us what you can build to make DAOs thrive.
-   **Privacy focused applications** - Blockchains in general are not the best for privacy of data. vetKeys on ICP help you build dapps in which users can preserve their privacy.
-   **RWA DeFi protocols** - With https outcalls, ICP canisters can bring in real world data streams on chain. We are looking for projects that tokenize new assets and bring them on chain.
-   **dAI** - With next-gen smart contracts that combine the scalability and user experience of web2 applications with the security guarantees of web3. ICP smart contracts can
    -   your project must be built on ICP, and all code must be in the repo above
   -   **Handle large amounts of data**: ICP’s next gen contracts can store and process gigabytes of data, unlike traditional smart contracts that can only handle kilobytes. This is both required for storing and executing large AI models as well as processing large amounts of input data.
   - **Superior computational power**: ICP’s next gen smart contracts provide significantly higher computational power per transaction compared to current generation blockchains (two orders of magnitude). In addition, they are optimized to handle the complex calculations needed for AI models (e.g. floating point operations), making them much faster and more efficient.
    
This enables ICP to be best protocol out there to build these types of AI solutions
---   Enterprise-level AI agents that are less susceptible to corporate espionage and sabotage
---   Internet-of-Things (IoT) AI agent-to-agent payment rails leveraging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
---   AI development traceability products, including verification that a model was trained on ethically-sourced data sets
---   Products that can frictionlessly transact vector database instances, creating data marketplaces
---   Products that allow multi-party ownership and control over AI deployments and applications
---   AI applications capable of securely storing underlying data sets.  For example, facial recognition software that doesn’t 
      expose PII of the persons in the training set or inputted into the inference engine.

##### Prizes

1. USD 3k in ICP grants
2. USD 1.5k in ICP grants
3. USD 0.5k in ICP grants

#### EVM dApps on ICP - Total Prize pool of USD 5k

[Bitfinity](https://bitfinity.network/) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implemented as a smart contract on Internet Computer Protocol
It helps scale the Ethereum ecosystem for developers to operate their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable, and future-safe platform, with low transaction costs for their users.

Here are some suggested themes. Projects are not limited to these verticals.

- DeFi (e.g. AMM, Aggregator, Lending & Borrowing, etc.)
- NFT & Gaming (e.g. NFT Platform, POAP dApp, Marketplace, Web3 Game etc.)
- Infrastructure (e.g. Remix, Bridge, Text Messaging, Internet Identity etc.)


##### Prizes

1. USD 3k in ICP grants
2. USD 1.5k in ICP grants
3. USD 0.5k in ICP grants
